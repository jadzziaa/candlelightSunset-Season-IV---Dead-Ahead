You will need to follow the directions on the the article here to make a Discord Application and Discord Bot account.

Follow all of "How to Make a Discord Bot in the Developer Portal" until you get to the "Now, you know how to make a Discord bot using the Developer Portal. Next comes the fun stuff: implementing your bot in Python!", where you can stop.
For Permissions, I only needed the bot Scope and the Send Messages text permission for my test.

For Python, you will likely need to install discord and may need to install nest_asyncio.
The commands to do so are:
$ pip install -U discord
$ pip install -U nest_asyncio

After everything is set up, you'll need to run the DiscordBot. This will need to run constantly, so I'd suggest setting up a script to run it when the server restarts or something, but will leave the details to you.
$ python DiscordBot.py
