-------------------
v.1.29.1
Our old designer didn’t show up for work in full. His arm was missing, his left leg was slightly gnawed, he moved not quite naturally, he made only one sound: "Hrrrr" and wanted to bite everyone a little. Given these circumstances, the designer had to be sent on an indefinite leave to rest and gain strength. So we had to hire a new designer who immediately got to work and refreshed the look of our trailers.

The first batch of updated trailers has already arrived at our dealerships. Come, choose, buy.

-------------------

We've heard customer complaints about our generator for a long time. Everyone was not happy, but no one could explain what exactly. And finally, a responsible buyer was found, who officially turned to the service center and described the problem in detail. We are glad to announce that we have found and eliminated a malfunction leading to the shutdown of the generator in the absence of its owner. And also, we stopped the reproduction of our generators. Please return all "childGEN" back to our factory.

In addition, all other trailers have been serviced. The wheelsets are reinforced, so you no longer want to suddenly exit the game (fixed a crash when vehicle stories with a trailer appeared).

v.1.08
We were forced to terminate cooperation with the company Vehicles Additions (https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?Id=2094336923). The reason is their reluctance to get in touch on the issue of replacing a number of defective spare parts. In this regard, we had to copy their drawings, modify them on our own and start our own production. The entire batch of new trailers has been recalled and replaced under our extended warranty.

P.S. We thank Vehicles Additions for the previous work. Without them, we would not have been able to found our company. It's a pity that we parted ways.
-------------------
v.1.07
We are glad to inform you about the update of our trailers. See the full list of improvements below.

Autotsar GNV:

In the new versions, the frame design has been redesigned, thanks to which we were able to achieve better dynamic performance, but at the same time we had to sacrifice capacity.
- for each trailer we have attached an information table on self-repair of the body. Now you can easily repair your trailer by finding the necessary items.

Autotsar iLYA-1990:
- installed unified seats;
- to replace windows, you no longer need doors;
- a trunk opening button is installed in the front of the cabin;
- now you can independently adapt any refrigerator and stove for use in a camper.

Kingly Benzin Amazing Cistern:
- the frame design has been changed. One axle was removed, new wheels of increased diameter with studded all-season tires were installed;
