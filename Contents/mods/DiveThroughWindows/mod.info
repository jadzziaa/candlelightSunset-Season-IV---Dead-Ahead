description= You've jumped through windows, but now can dive through windows like a badass! <LINE> <LINE> NEW (12/2/2022) - Customizable roll animation chances, and a new animation for successfully diving through a closed window! <LINE> Uses the sprinting fence-hop animations instead of the window climb animation.<LINE> Get a good headstart; not dashing long enough before hitting a window will break the glass but will bounce you back. <LINE> Running skill, Nimble skill, and armor protection lower the risk of injury. <LINE> Traits also affect your window-diving experience. (Over/Underweight, Graceful, Thick Skin, etc.) <LINE> Tested to work in MP <LINE> <LINE> Unofficial successor to the Jump Through Windows mod <LINE> IMPORTANT: Do NOT enable at the same time as Jump Through Windows. There may be conflicts. <LINE> <LINE> Developed by Jay
