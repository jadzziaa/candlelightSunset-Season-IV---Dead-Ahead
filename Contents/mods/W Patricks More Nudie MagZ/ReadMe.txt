Hello!
I'm W. Patrick

I've been playing a while and this is my fourth mod. (Second one released)
As I progress in the world of modding and better understand the various mechanics and functions (I know a good bit about JS so far), I'll continue to make other mods. I am very interested in making new ones, and would love to work with other modders and come up with ideas and implement them.



================ More Nudie MagZ ================


This mod is basic and adds a few new bad moodle reduction items.

The apocalypse is tough, let's be honest. And we're all adults here, right? Or at least I hope. (Don't worry, none of the content is beyond PG-13 at worst, it's all very tasteful)

Added in this mod are some new features, recipes, and functions I discovered from experimentation. (All tested and works fine with vanilla).
