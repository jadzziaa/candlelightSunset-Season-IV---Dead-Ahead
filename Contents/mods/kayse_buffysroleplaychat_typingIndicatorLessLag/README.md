# PZ-roleplaychat

Otherwise hello and welcome, feel free to PR changes.

# FOR ADDING TRANSLATIONS:

Create a new folder in the 'Translate' folder with your language letters and follow the format of the existing UI_EN.txt file. Leave the spaces in place!
You can view other mods for how this sort of thing is structured. For example, English translation has a folder called 'EN' and its file is 'UI_EN.txt'. Russian language would be RU, and its file 'UI_RU.txt' and so on.

If you'd like this mod translated into your preferred language, and don't know how to contribute, reach out to buffy#0001 on Discord.
