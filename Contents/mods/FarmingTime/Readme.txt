Soul Filcher's Farming Time
By Soul Filcher, 2017 - 2019.
Downloaded from Steam Workshop.

The main objective of this mod is to allow compatibility between separate farming mods
without the need to add crop types to the main farming files. For this reason I have not
added crop types that already exist in the Farmoid mod. To make farming mods compatible
they need to be updated to use my modified files. Check the examples I used in this mod.

-----FEATURES-----------------------------------------------------------------------

-Allows new crop types in the "Sow Seed" menu without the need to replace ISFarmingMenu.
-Adds new crop types without the need to change farming_vegetableconf.
-Uses specific grow functions for each type, without the need to reference them in basicFarming.
-Allows custom growing stage descriptions (seedling, young...) for each stage, Check corn for examples.
-Allows custom plants to remain in a spot when harvested just like strawberries. They revert to the growing stage number defined in "retainOnHarvest" for that crop type.



-----ADDED CROPS--------------------------------------------------------------------

-Beets:         Beets can be used to make sugar, find the recipe in a new magazine.  
-Cauliflower:   
-Corn:          Corn will not give seeds, but you can remove them from the corn item.
		By using a Grain Grinder you can turn the seeds into Cornflour.
-Wheat:         Just like corn, wheat will not give seeds separately, you need to get
                them from the stalks, or find packets.



-----ADDED ITEMS - MISC STUFF-------------------------------------------------------

-Cloth:             A piece of cloth that can be ripped. It is needed to make a syrup
		    from cooked beets, in order to make sugar. More uses in the future.
-Grain Grinder:     Required for making flour from wheat grain.
-Guide to Flour:    Teaches recipes
-Insecticide Spray: Spray can that can be found, works just like the crafted version.      
-Mildew Spray:      Spray can that can be found, works just like the crafted version.



-----ADDED RECIPES AND FIXES--------------------------------------------------------

-Make Beet Syrup:   Cook 5 beets in a Cooking Pot with water, then use Cloth to filter
		    the mashed beets into a syrup.
-Make Cornflour:    Turns Corn Seeds into Cornflour. Requires a Grain Grinder.
-Make Flour:        Turns Wheat Grain into Flour. Requires a Grain Grinder.
-Remove Sugar From Pot: Cooked beet syrup turns into sugar.
-Thresh Corn:       You can get corn seeds from any corn you find or harvest.
-Thresh Wheat:      Turn wheat stalks into free grain.
