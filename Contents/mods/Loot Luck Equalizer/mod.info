description=When a container (drawers, shelves, crates etc.) gets its loot generated by the game (when you walk close enough to it), if the container is empty or has very few items, this mod has a 65% chance (+/- 15% with Lucky/Unclucky Trait), to effectively re-roll the loot generation so that less containers are empty. This makes repeating the same game mode more consistent, while still feeling random and realistic.
