This mod adds modifiers to weapons and bags, and displays their effects on the item's tooltip.

While it may not be very realistic, it does provide a lot of variance on the loot and quality of weapons.

[h1]Tooltip stats :[/h1]
Inspired and tweaked from the mod "Show weapon stats". On the tooltips, the item stats are shown in yellow.
The stats of the modifier (if the item has one) are ALREADY applied to those stats.
The stats in parenthesis are the bonuses from the players' traits and skills, NOT from the modifiers.


[h1]Modifiers :[/h1]
Each item has 75% chance to get a modifier.
Each modifier can have 1 of 6 colors, each representing its quality:
[list]
[*] dark red: shitty
[*] grey: bad
[*] white: common
[*] green: good
[*] blue: great
[*] purple : epic
[*] light red: insane
[*] orange: legendary
[/list]
Many modify only one stat. Others modify multiple stats. There may be both bonuses and maluses on a modifier.
