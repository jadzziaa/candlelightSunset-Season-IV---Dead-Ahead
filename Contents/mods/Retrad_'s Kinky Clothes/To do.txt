blindfold (coding problem)
-when worn player is blinded
-slower inventory transfer
-can't read

-trigger on clothing equip -> if name has "blindfold" then -> add black fog overlay or something






boot plug (model problem)
-run speed is cut in half because...

-move vanilla spiffo tail under player (change model? attachment point?)






straightjacket (animation problem)
-can't transfer items
-can't spear fish
-can't build
-can't... yeah...

-need animation where player folds arms in by her side (or his) and then it's just textures
