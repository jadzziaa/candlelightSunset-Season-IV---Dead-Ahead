============= COMPATIBILITY =============

BRITA's WEAPONS / GUNFIGHTER - When Brita's weapon mod is active, all weapons from the gun store distribution are added to zombie drops. The multiplier for zombie drops is controlled by the "other guns" multiplier in sandbox. The zombie loot distribution should take into account any weapon settings set in gunfighter options, so for example if post-1993 weapons are removed in those settings they should not appear on zombies. Same goes for disabled weapons or ammo types.
My suggestion for Brita's, if you want to fine-tune non-police zombie gun drops, would be to disable the zombie weapon drops entirely within gunfighter settings and adjust drops with the "other guns" multiplier in this mod to fine-tune and make the drops as rare as you need.

FIREARMS B41 - When Firearms b41 is active, all the new firearms and ammo are added to the table of items dropped from zombies, tuneable by the pistol/long gun sandbox modifiers.

ANY MOD - Using the extra rolls feature in sandbox, you can insert any modded item to zombie loot, so compatibility is dependant to user.
Example1: "ItemID1:chance;ItemID2:chance;ItemID3:chance"
Example2: "Base.BaseballBat:1;Base.Crowbar:5;Base.Axe:5"
